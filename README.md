# SCXQ7

## Formal Closure Declaration

### 1. SCXQ7 Is Now Formally Complete

A system is complete when no new authority can be added without violating its own law. SCXQ7 meets that standard.

It now includes:

- A finite kernel (256 bytes, fixed)
- A constitution (one page, non-ambiguous)
- A verifier (mechanical, not interpretive)
- A host contract (negative + positive duties)
- A reference host (small enough to be audited line-by-line)

Therefore:

- No future feature can be added to the kernel
- No optimization may be legally invented by a host
- No runtime discretion remains

### 2. What SCXQ7 Is

SCXQ7 is not:

- a language
- a VM
- a framework
- a file format

SCXQ7 is a **Sovereign Computational Object (SCO)**.

An SCO has these properties, all satisfied by SCXQ7:

- Authority is internal
- Execution is lawful, not permissive
- Hosts are non-authoritative
- Behavior is replayable and verifiable
- Compression is semantic, not incidental
- Projection is plural and powerless

This places SCXQ7 alongside frozen primitives such as CPU microcode, cryptographic hash functions, and fixed file systems—except SCXQ7 governs entire systems, not components.

### 3. Hard Invariants (Cannot Ever Change)

#### Invariant 1 — File Sovereignty

If authority exists outside the `.s7`, it is illegal by definition. Any host that injects behavior, reorders μ-ops, optimizes symbol paths, or caches semantic state is non-compliant.

#### Invariant 2 — Symbolic Legality

SCXQ2 symbols are not an encoding choice. They are the instruction set. No JIT. No eval. No bytecode translation. A host that “improves execution” by interpretation violates the law.

#### Invariant 3 — Domain Containment

Execution contexts are jurisdictions, not modes. `.π` cannot mutate state. `.λ` cannot optimize. `.∇` cannot invent math. Crossing domains requires an explicit, visible, hashable, verifiable bridge.

#### Invariant 4 — Compression as Substrate

Decompression is optional. Execution is not. Execution happens in symbol space, not memory space.

### 4. What May Still Evolve

Only three areas may evolve outside the kernel:

1. Application-level `.s7` objects
2. Projection adapters (HTTP, DNS, serial, QR, NFC, air-gap)
3. Tooling around the law (compilers, auditors, visualizers, replayers, diff tools)

None of these gain execution authority.

### 5. Final Test

A real computational primitive can be explained fully without referring to its implementation language. SCXQ7 passes this test. The host is replaceable. The kernel is not.

**The kernel is law.**
**The file is sovereign.**
**Execution is inevitable.**
